					<h3>Duty Manager Rotation Scheduling Tool / DM ROTA Tool</h3>
					<p>
					The Duty Manager or DM is a point of contact for incoming issues or "tickets" raised by the end-user. 
					Every branch of business has a DM assigned.
					On a business standpoint if everything goes well, The DM will accept the ticket via the HP Service Manager 
					software or SM9 and assign it to the right IT specialist. <br/><br/>
					There are however certain occassions where the issue / ticket isn't correctly raised to the correct DM as there are too many branch to ask on which DM should take care of the ticket and it gets confusing.
					<br/><br/>The DM ROTA Tool is a web application created to be a self-service portal wherein all the DM's for that day are recorded, 
					At what time they will go to office? their contact number? their backup if one of them is on sick leave or on leave.
					This will ensure that every ticket will be taken care of, effectively reducing SLA impact and increasing productivity. Ensuring the end-user that their issues are being taken care of. 
					<br/><br/>Coded using HTML, CSS, PHP using CodeIgniter framework and MySQL for the database.

					<h3>Automatic Ticket Assignment Tool or ATAT</h3>
					<p>
					HP uses a software called the HP Service Manager software or SM9 to <br/>
					collect all the issues / ticket the end-user has raised.
					<br/><br/>The Duty Manager or the DM, manually assigns these tickets to the right IT specialist.
					<br/><br/>Being the DM is overwhelming since you handle everything from assigning tickets to <br/>informing your supervisor if there is a red alert ticket. This process is prone to human errors.
					<br/><br/>ATAT is created to ensure to lift certain responsibilities from the DM, <br/>the machine will be the one to assign the ticket to the IT specialist using a system called the round robin assignment.
					<br/><br/>This will ensure correct ticket distribution within the team and the knowledge to be spread out.
					<br/><br/>Algorithm is coded using Python implementing the use of IMacro and OpenTwebst. <br/>Web Application is coded using HTML, CSS, PHP using CodeIgniter framework and MYSQL for the database.

					<h3>Job Monitoring Tool or Overwatch</h3>
					<p>
					The use of this tool is SAP related. <br/>
					In a non-sap jargon, this tool monitors processes relating to finances, payroll, exchange rates etc.
					<br/><br/>
					From SAP, an email functionality is activated that will send the status of these processes in HTML format.<br/>
					Using Python scripts, the data from the email will be extracted then be processed and saved into the database.
					<br/><br/>
					The user of the tool can set an alert if a certain process changes status (For example: Running to Failed)<br/>
					If the process then meet the standard set by the user, the tool will then alert the user via email or sms.
					<br/><br/>
					The user that has been alerted by the tool can now act accordingly on what step to take. <br/>
					Possibly to prevent an issue from happening or alert the higher management of a possible outbreak.
					<br/><br/>
					Algorithm is coded using Python. <br/>Web Application is coded using HTML, CSS, Javascript, Jquery, PHP using Laravel framework and MYSQL for the database.

					<h3>Root Cause Analysis and Incident Management Tool</h3>
					<p>
					For an average Incident Manager, consolidating and compiling every form answered for RCA is time consuming. 
					<br/><br/>
					Especially if you are running a large team.
					<br/><br/>
					The RCA and INM Tool was created as a portal to automatically gather the issues / ticket for analysis.<br/>
					Once the ticket has been consolidated, the IT specialist will then be alerted.<br/>
					Every team member will then analyze the ticket and when done will alert the INM Manager.
					<br/><br/>
					The INM Manager will then have the ticket compiled and organized into categories.<br/>
					The compiled ticket can then be easily extracted into a formatted excel file to be sent to higher management for reporting.
					<br/><br/>
					Algorithm for extracting the ticket is coded using Python.<br/>
					Web Application is coded using HTML, CSS, AngularJS, PHP using Laravel framework and MySQL for the database.

					<h3>HUD Painter - Proof of Concept</h3>
					<p>
					I was assigned a secret project that was deemed ambitious enough to be the product flagship of HPE.
					<br/><br/>
					The idea is to create a platform for higher management to have an oversee on the operations for every client.<br/>
					There will be 2 applications. One application to collect data from any datasource possible and another<br/>
					to display these data in an easy to understand but sleek product. 
					<br/><br/>
					This project was already lost to India but as a team we were determined to get the project back.
					<br/><br/>
					After many sleepless nights even resorting to sleeping and spending days in the office.<br/>
					We were able to take the project back and further develop it.
					<br/><br/>
					As a prize, we won the HPE's finest award and I was presented with an opportunity to be the technical lead of HUD Builder.
					<br/><br/>
					Web Application is coded using HTML, CSS, Javascript, Jquery, AJAX, JSON and PHP using Laravel framework.
